# wxs_core
The WXScripts core resource - including loads of utility for creating your scripts

## What is it?
Our core is a collection of scripts that we use across our resources. It's got stuff for blips, callbacks, markers, game pools, synchronized scenes, streaming, vehicles and then "Foact" - our own UI library made for making UIs entirely in LUA.
Feel free to use this resource in your scripts, even in scripts you sell! Just link to our git repo for downloading it.
Want something complicated simplified with our core for your scripts? Reach out on Discord, and we might be able to do just that!

## Documentation
We've made some pretty detailed documentation over at https://docs.wxs.gg/, so make sure to read that before asking us questions.
It *should* cover everything, if not, let us know and we'll fix it.

## Support
We *might* provide some support on this resource if asked, provided that you've tried to help yourself first.
Feel free to ask questions in our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/tpJE2854th)!

## Pull requests
We ❤️ pull requests! We'll gladly look at pull requests with new additions or fixes for our code.
We'll probably write some guidelines soon, but for now just try to include as much detail about your work as possible.

## What is Foact?
You might be thinking, what the flip is Foact? Currently it's a UI library for writing UIs in LUA, without the need for HTML or JavaScript. The name started of as being FiveM and React mashed together, but at this point it's got little incommon with React, other than it's a UI library.

I highly encurage you to read more about it on our Docs: [Foact Docs](https://docs.wxs.gg/docs/Core/Modules/Foact/)!

Here's a UI we made with Foact:
